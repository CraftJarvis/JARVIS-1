    This Minecraft Security Door will look great in all of your houses and should
    look a lot better than the standard Minecraft Security Door designs you are used
    to.   To make  a work security door  we need buttons  iron doors and wooden pressure
    plates. Step 1  punch a hole in the middle of a room's wall and this is where
    the door will be put. Step 2  go inside of the room and then place the door down.
    Step 3  place the pressure plate on top of the block that is above the door. Step
    4  build a ceiling. Step 5  place a button inside the room besides the door.

    of storage space. There is a hidden away brewing slush farming area on the ground
    floor. On the second floor which is only accessible via a ladder to the right
    of the front entrance we have even more storage. We have more terraces and more
    hidden away chests and secret items along with access to yet another floor where
    we keep all of valuables including beds and a cheeky hidden away ender chest.
    There is also access to one of the many balconies or terraces hidden away across
