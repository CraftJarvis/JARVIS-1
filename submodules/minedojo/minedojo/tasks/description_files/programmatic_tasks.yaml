  category: harvest
  guidance: '1. Find some coal. Coal is fairly easy to find, especially if you are
    in or near a cave. You can also find coal by destroying dark blocks with your
    hand or with a pickaxe.

    2. Craft a crafting table. To do this, you will need four blocks of wood. Place
    the blocks of wood in your crafting grid so that they are arranged in a square.
    This will give you a crafting table.

    3. Place the crafting table in the world. Right-click on the ground to place the
    crafting table in the world.

    4. Open the crafting table. Right-click on the crafting table to open it. This
    will give you a 3x3 crafting grid.

    5. Place the coal in the crafting grid. Place your coal in the crafting grid so
    that it is in the middle slot of the second row.

    6. Craft a furnace. To do this, you will need eight blocks of cobblestone. Place
    the cobblestone in the crafting grid so that it is arranged in a square around
    the coal. This will give you a furnace.

    7. Place the furnace in the world. Right-click on the ground to place the furnace
    in the world.

    8. Right-click on the furnace. This will open the furnace menu.

    9. Place your fuel in the bottom slot of the furnace. Coal is a good fuel for
    a furnace, but you can also use wood or charcoal.

    10. Place the item you want to smelt in the top slot of the furnace.

    11. Wait for the furnace to smelt the item. The time it takes for an item to smelt
